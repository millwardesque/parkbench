# React Router v7 Migration

This project has been migrated from React Router v6 to v7.

## Changes Made

1. **Package Updates**:

   - Added `react-router` v7.0.0 to replace `react-router-dom`
   - React Router v7 consolidates all functionality into a single package

2. **API Changes**:
   - Removed usage of deprecated `json` helper from `@remix-run/node` in favor of direct object returns
   - Updated error responses to use native `Response.json()` method

## Testing

The application has been tested with the development server running, and all routes appear to be functioning correctly.
